guide.magicalsculpture:intro.text1=Looks like you just made a statuary chisel. Congratulations, now you can start building statues! Relics inside a statue add BUFF effect to nearby players. Use diamonds, stones and chests to craft statuary stone and base.

guide.magicalsculpture:structure.text2=Base: 2x2x1 (Total: 4) of statuary base.
guide.magicalsculpture:structure.text3=The sculpture is a multi-block structure. Place blocks as shown in the figure then right-click it with the sculpture chisel.
guide.magicalsculpture:structure.text4=The statue will provide BUFF for players in a certain range. The type of BUFF depends on the relics placed in it.
guide.magicalsculpture:structure.text5=Right-click on the statue body and place relics to enable the BUFF effect.
guide.magicalsculpture:structure.text6=Right-click on the statue base and insert amplifiers to increase the range.

guide.magicalsculpture:relics.text1=Explore the world, synthesize by hand or fish by the river to collect more relics!

guide.magicalsculpture:amplifier.text1=Concern about the BUFF range? By crafting and placing amplifiers, the range can be extended!
guide.magicalsculpture:amplifier.text2=Increase the radius by 4 blocks
guide.magicalsculpture:amplifier.text3=Increase the radius by 8 blocks
guide.magicalsculpture:amplifier.text4=Increase the radius by 12 blocks
guide.magicalsculpture:amplifier.text5=Increase the radius by 16 blocks

guide.magicalsculpture:notes.text1=The Magic Sculpture is a MOD made by Yuri's Cat and Rikka0w0. It only took 48 hours to make this mod.
guide.magicalsculpture:notes.text2=Since we don't have much spare time, some features have not been implemented, so recently, "Magic Sculpture" is not going to add new features, however we will continue the maintenance.
guide.magicalsculpture:notes.text3=More features will be added in the future: new BUFFs, more sculpture, more magic devices... Of course, it will be in the "Magic Sculpture 2". —— I mean, if possible.
guide.magicalsculpture:notes.text4=Thanks again to Rikka0w0 for his programming efforts in his spare time.
guide.magicalsculpture:notes.text5=Thank you for playing！
